# HopSpotter - Social Brewery App
â€‹
In this project I collaborated directly with a product owner in a team-based Agile environment to create a full-stack responsive web app that
allows users to browse local breweries, see the available beers at each, and review ones they have sampled using HTML/CSS,
JavaScript, Vue.js, Java, and SQL.
